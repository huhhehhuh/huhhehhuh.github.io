<Slide1>
My name is SungBeen Lee, and today I will be giving a presentation on the topic of evolution.

<Slide2>
This presentation was inspired by a passage from Reading Unit 16, Practice 3 in the Olympus English.

<Slide3>
While reading that passage, I became curious about this question:
“How does the mechanism of evolution work?”
That question led me to explore this topic further and prepare this presentation.

<Slide4>
Let’s begin by looking at different perspectives on evolution introduced in the text.
The first is the theory of the Great Chain of Being, which originated in ancient and medieval times.
This theory claims that the universe is organized in a strict hierarchy, from God → Angels → Humans → Animals → Plants -> non-living thing, with each being fixed in its assigned place.
In this view, change or evolution does not occur, and moving up or down the chain is impossible.
The higher up the chain, the more “perfect” the being is considered; the lower, the more “primitive.”
This stands in stark contrast to modern evolutionary theory.

<Slide5>
Next, let’s look at Lamarckian evolution.
This theory is based on two main ideas:
Use and disuse, and the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
It suggests that body parts that are used frequently develop over time, while unused parts shrink.
And the traits gained during a lifetime are passed on to the offspring.
A famous example is the giraffe. Lamarck believed that early giraffes stretched their necks to reach higher leaves.
As a result, their necks gradually became longer, and this acquired trait was inherited by the next generation.
However, modern genetics has disproven this theory—acquired traits are not inherited—so Lamarck’s theory is no longer scientifically accepted.

<Slide6>
Finally, we have Darwinian evolution, which explains that certain mutations become more common over time through natural selection.
A famous example is the Galápagos finches.
Darwin observed that finches on different islands had different beak shapes suited to their local food sources.
This showed how environmental adaptation leads to the gradual evolution of traits.

<Slide7>
So, why has Darwin’s theory become the mainstream understanding of evolution?
There are three key reasons:
First,Extensive observational evidence supports it.
Second,The mechanism of natural selection is logically consistent and clear.
Third, After Darwin, new fields like genetics and molecular biology emerged and provided further scientific validation of his theory.

<Slide8>
Darwin’s theory is based on natural selection, which consists of four stages:
1.Variation – Random genetic mutations and recombination create differences among individuals.
2.Overproduction – Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support.
3.Struggle for existence – Individuals compete for limited resources.
4.Survival of the fittest – Those best suited to their environment survive and reproduce more, passing their traits on.
Over time, this process leads to gradual changes in the species.

<Slide9>
As mentioned in the 올림포스 text, evolution is not about perfection, but about satisficing—being “good enough” to survive.
For example, let’s say a prey animal like a sheep evolves to run faster, increasing its speed from 40 to 50.
A predator like a lion doesn’t need to evolve to 60 or 70—it only needs to run at about 53 to catch the sheep.
Perfect speed would waste energy, so just being slightly better than the competition is enough.
That’s the key idea: evolution favors efficiency, not perfection.

<Slide10>
In the future, evolution may take new forms.
With the development of gene-editing tools like CRISPR(크리스퍼가위), we may see intentional or artificial evolution through genetic engineering.

<Slide11>
This led me to think:
What if we applied evolutionary principles to AI systems?

If we introduced a form of random variation, like biological mutation, into the AI’s learning process,
could we create an AI that evolves on its own—just like living organisms?

Interestingly, some recent studies show that adding random rewards in AI learning processes has improved performance in problem-solving, like solving math problems.
This suggests that my evolutionary thinking might actually help us develop more higher AI systems.

Thank you very much for listening.
